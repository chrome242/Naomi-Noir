            essay on what she wanted to be when she grew up. She alternated 
            between wanting to be a scientist and an artist. One year she said that 
            she wanted to be both and was told by the teacher to pick one. Her 
            first career was as a research biologist in plant pathology. Presently 
            she is developing her skills in photography and the visual arts. Who 
            says that you can't do both?</p>
